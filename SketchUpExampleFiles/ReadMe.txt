Welcome! This zip archive contains the example code for the book
"Beginning Google Sketchup for 3D Printing". The example code is
organized into folders by chapter. There is no code for chapters 
1 & 2. Code does exist for all subsequent chapters. Chapter 7's 
code is split across two folders.

We also want to make you aware of the author's own website for
the book. You can find that site at the following URL:

http://reallybuildthings.com/

The site is an alternate source of the example code. The author
also maintains some useful links and other information relating
to 3D Printing.

Thank you for your interest in the book. We very much hope that 
you enjoy it.
